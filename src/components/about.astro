    <p class="no-indent">Welcome, Wanderer.</p>
    <p>
      Imagine a web where you aren’t constantly interrupted by pop-ups, tracked
      by invisible scripts, or bombarded by ads. A web that feels like a quiet
      library—a place where you can explore freely, without someone watching
      over your shoulder. That’s the web I dream of. <span
        >And that’s why I built MazeNet.</span
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>MazeNet</strong> wasn’t born in a boardroom or drafted on a spreadsheet.
      It was created late at night, fueled by frustration and a stubborn hope that
      the internet could be better. I’d grown tired of visiting websites that treated
      me as a commodity, a data point to be mined, analyzed, and sold. I wanted something
      simpler—sites that valued purpose over profit, experience over engagement metrics.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, I started building. One by one, I created single-purpose
      websites—tools and applications designed to solve a specific problem
      simply and effectively. No clutter, no distractions, no tracking. Just a
      clear, focused experience. Little by little, these projects came together,
      forming an ecosystem that embodies the values I care about: <span
        >simplicity, transparency, and privacy.</span
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>MazeNet</strong> isn’t just a collection of websites. It’s a personal
      project—a testament to what the web can be when it’s crafted by someone who
      cares about people, not profits. Every site is open-source, because I believe
      in transparency. Every site is free, because I believe the best things on the
      internet should be. And every site respects your privacy, because your data
      is yours, not mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      I don’t run ads, I don’t track visitors, and I don’t clutter my sites with
      features no one asked for. <strong>MazeNet</strong> isn’t here to grow clicks
      or monetize attention. It’s here to offer a pure experience—a web that’s simple,
      focused, and respectful.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is a one-person mission. Funded by those who believe in it. Open to
      anyone who wants to contribute. Created to give you something rare: <span
        >a web that treats you like a person.</span
      >
